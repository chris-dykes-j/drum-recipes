# drum-recipes

Inspired by John Pickering's "The Drummer's Cookbook," this website generates a semi-random drum groove.
The groove is displayed in three line notation for the bass drum, snare, and hihat/ride cymbal.

Still a WIP.

Nabbing notes from this site for the time being (https://freesvg.org/eighth-note-vector).
